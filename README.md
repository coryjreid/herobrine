# Herobrine

A fake player to keep your farms active.

**There are currently _no plans_ to port to Minecraft versions greater than 1.12.2!**

## Commands
* `/herobrine spawn <name>` \
  Spawn a new Herobrine in the world at your location if it was never spawned before. \
  If the Herobrine was previously spawned, they will spawn at that location.
* `/herobrine move <name>` \
  Move a spawned Herobrine to your current location.
* `/herobrine move <name> <x> <y> <z> <dimension id>` \
  Move a spawned Herobrine to the specific location and dimension.
* `/herobrine kill <name>` \
  Remove a spawned Herobrine from the world (despawn it).

## Usage
Spawn the Herobrine where you want it to stand to keep a farm loaded as if a player is AFKing there! If you need to move
the Herobrine use the `move` command. To remove the Herobrine use the `kill/delete` command.

### Notes 
* There are currently no limits on how many Herobrines you can spawn.
* You cannot spawn Herobrines with duplicate names.
* You must be Operator to use the command.
